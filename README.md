# Lead-Funnel Strom & Gas

This repository contains the full application stack for the "Lead-Funnel Strom & Gas" project.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a fully automated sales funnel for an energy cooperative. It handles the entire process from a potential customer visiting a landing page to a legally binding contract being signed.

The architecture is based on a set of containerized microservices orchestrated by Docker Compose.

## Getting Started

All services are defined and configured in the `app/infra/` directory. For detailed instructions on how to set up the environment, build the services, and run the entire stack, please refer to the infrastructure documentation.
